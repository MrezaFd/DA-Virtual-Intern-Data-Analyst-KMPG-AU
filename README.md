## ðŸ“‚ **Task 1 - Data Quality Assessment**

### **Background Information**
Sprocket Central Pty Ltd seeks assistance in handling their customer and transactions data. Although they possess a substantial dataset regarding their customers, they lack the expertise to effectively analyze it for optimizing their marketing strategy.
Recognizing the significance of optimizing the quality of customer datasets, they understand that improved data quality enhances the potential to drive company growth.

In response to this, the client has entrusted KPMG with three datasets:
- Customer Demographic
- Customer Addresses
- Transactions data from the past three months
### **Goals**
The main objectives are to assess and evaluate the data based on Standard Data Quality Dimensions and subsequently devise strategies to address any identified issues. This endeavor aims to equip Sprocket Central with the valuable insights needed to propel their marketing efforts to success.
<br>

## ðŸ“‚ **Task 2 - Data Insights**

### **Background Information**
The marketing team of Sprocket Central Pty Ltd aims to enhance their business by analyzing their current customer dataset to uncover valuable customer trends and behavior. Using the existing labeled dataset consisting of three datasets (Customer demographic, customer address, and transactions), the objective is to recommend which of the 1000 new customers should be targeted to maximize the organization's value <br>
<br>

### **Goals**
- Create customer segmentation using the RFM model.
- Analyze customer trends, behavior, and demographics.<br>
<br>

## ðŸ“‚ **Task 3 - Data Insights and Presentation**

### **Background Information**
After building the model we need to present our results back to the client. A list of customers or algorithm wonâ€™t cut it with the client, we need to support our results with the use of visualisations.<br>
<br>

### **Goals**
- Develop a dashboard with looker studio<br>
<br>
